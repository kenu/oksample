              <p>
                In March 1936, an unusual confluence of forces occurred in 
                Santa Clara County.
              </p>
              <p>
                A long cold winter delayed the blossoming of the millions of 
                cherry, apricot, peach, and prune plum trees covering hundreds 
                of square miles of the Valley floor. Then, unlike many years, 
                the rains that followed were light and too early to knock 
                the blossoms from their branches.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead, by the billions, they all burst open at once. 
                Seemingly overnight, the ocean of green that was the Valley 
                turned into a low, soft, dizzyingly perfumed cloud of pink 
                and white. Uncounted bees and yellow jackets, newly born, 
                raced out of their hives and holes, overwhelmed by this 
                impossible banquet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then came the wind.
              </p>
              <p>
                It roared off the Pacific Ocean, through the nearly 
                uninhabited passes of the Santa Cruz Mountains and then, 
                flattening out, poured down into the great alluvial plains 
                of the Valley. A tidal bore of warm air, it tore along the 
                columns of trees, ripped the blossoms apart and carried them 
                off in a fluttering flood of petals like foam rolling up a 
                beach.
              </p>
              <p>
                This perfumed blizzard hit Stevens Creek Boulevard, a two-lane
                road with a streetcar line down its center, that was the main
                road in the West Valley. It froze traffic, as drivers found
                themselves lost in a soft, muted whiteout. Only the streetcar,
                its path predetermined, passed on...
